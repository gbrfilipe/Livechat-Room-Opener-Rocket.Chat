# Rocket.Chat - Room Opener

This python script will open a room getting visitor data from the public API https://randomuser.me/.
Change the url_rc and department variables to match your workspace/department.

Have a look at the customFields, in my server, it has some customFields. Feel free to delete them at the visitor payload.

*At the moment, it does not work with Manual Selection at Omnichannel Routing Method.
