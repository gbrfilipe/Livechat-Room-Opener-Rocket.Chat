# Rocket.Chat - Room Opener

This Python script opens a room with visitor information from the public API https://randomuser.me/.
Change the url_rc and department variables to match your workspace/department.

Have a look at the customFields, in my server, it has some customFields. If your server does not have customFields, feel free to delete them at the visitor payload.

Keep at least one livechat agent online.

*At the moment, it does not work with Manual Selection at Omnichannel Routing Method.
